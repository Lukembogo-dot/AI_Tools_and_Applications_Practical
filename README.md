# AI_Tools_and_Applications_Practical
Core AI toolsâ€”Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and spaCy

# AI Toolkit Pro
A group project for the AI Tools Assignment, showcasing mastery of TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and spaCy.

## Overview
This project implements:
1. **Task 1: Classical ML** - Decision tree classifier on the Iris dataset.
2. **Task 2: Deep Learning** - CNN for MNIST digit classification (>95% accuracy).
3. **Task 3: NLP** - NER and sentiment analysis on Amazon Reviews.
4. **Bonus Task** - Deployed MNIST classifier using Streamlit.
5. **Ethics & Debugging** - Bias analysis and TensorFlow script debugging.

## Setup
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Toolkit-Pro.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install spaCy model: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
4. Run notebooks in VS Code (Jupyter extension) or Google Colab (Task 2).
5. Run Streamlit app: `streamlit run app/app.py`

## Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for tasks and debugging.
- `app/`: Streamlit app and MNIST model.
- `report/`: Markdown for theoretical and ethical sections.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Ignores unnecessary files.


## Deliverables
- **Code**: Notebooks and app in this repository.
- **Report**: PDF in `report/` (submitted on LMS Community).
- **Presentation**: 3-minute video (uploaded to LMS Community).
