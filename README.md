Core AI tools—Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and spaCy

Introduction 

This report explores core AI tools—Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and spaCy—through both 
theory and practical implementation. By working with real datasets like Iris, MNIST, and Amazon 
reviews, we apply classical machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing 
techniques. The goal is to understand how these tools function, compare their strengths, and 
consider ethical implications in building fair and effective AI models.
